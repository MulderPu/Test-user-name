Extend the program to have it test user names - a Silly name testing program.
¦Create 4 message variables, and 4 different message objects.
¦Get the user to enter their name, and output one of the messages for that user. For example
(use your own name and names of your friends, not these names):
¦ "Andrew" gets the message "Welcome back oh great creator!"
¦ "Fred" gets the message "What a lovely name"
¦ "Wilma" gets "Great name"
¦ anyone else gets "That is a silly name"
